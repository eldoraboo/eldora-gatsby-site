Hi! I'm Eldora and I am currently an undergraduate at the National University of Singapore with a degree in Data Science & Analytics. My interests are in Full Stack Development and Data Science.

I first started developing when I picked up HTML/CSS at age of 13 and discovered my interest in front end development. I started creating static websites with simple CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and SASS.

In my pre-university education, I continued pursuing my interest by exposing myself to back end programming languages like JavaScript and Python in my free time. It helped me built user-friendly Whatsapp/Telegram bots.

Finally, while pursuing my undergraduate studies in data science, I worked with data structures & algorithms, statistical computing, and numerical computations using languages like SQL and R.

You can contact me by email at eldoraboo.mby@gmail.com to say hi! I always appreciate meeting new people.

# What I'm doing now

_Updated December 3rd, 2022_

I've been picking up crocheting and more specifically, amigurumi. It takes a lot of patience. You miss one stitch, and you need to go all the way back to where you started. Programming as well, when you first start a project, it seems like you are on the right track, but when you finally deploy the product, bugs start popping out of everywhere! Then you would need to backtrack your progress and find that missing stitch. My next big project is a strawberry cow though >.<
